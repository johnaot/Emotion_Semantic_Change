## Execution

### Illustrating the prototype hypothesis

To generate the illustration for our main hypothesis, run `jupyter notebook figure_1`

### Reconstruction of prototypicality

To run reconstruction of human prototypicality and create figure 2, run `jupyter notebook figure_2`

### Analyses of emotion semantic change

To run regression analyses on semantic change of emotion words and create figure 3, run `jupyter notebook figure_3`

### Analyses of semantic change in bird names

To run regression analyses on semantic change of bird names and create figure 4, run `jupyter notebook figure_4`

### Historical analyses of prototypicality judgement

To perform analyses described in SI section 1, run `jupyter notebook SI_section_1`

### Evaluation of the nearest-neighbour measure

To perform analyses described in SI section 2, run `jupyter notebook SI_section_2`

### Category-bounded analyses of emotion semantic change

To perform analyses described in SI section 3, run `jupyter notebook SI_section_3`

### Other factors of emotion semantic chang

To perform analyses described in SI section 4, run `jupyter notebook SI_section_4`

### Comparison of semantic change in emotion and bird categories

To perform analyses described in SI section 5, run `jupyter notebook SI_section_5`

### Analyses of other semantic categories

To perform analyses described in SI section 6, run `jupyter notebook SI_section_6`
